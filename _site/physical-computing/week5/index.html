      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and visualizing different patterns from basic geometric shapes on Processing. During the exploration, I have faced constant reconsideration in the concept as I also imagined how to make the interaction more interesting. I gradually finalized the idea of creating a textile interface that contains several mended touchpoints. With this idea, I am curious about the relationship between physical touching and digital visualisation that overlays on top of each other.
      </p>
      <p class="bold"> The learning so far:</p>
       <p>— I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. I so far have used random() to generate unexpectedly interesting patterns out of basic shapes like rectangles and circles (Img 1).</p>
       <p>— The process of working with soft electronic materials opens up my new interest, even though I have just scratched the surface of electronic textiles. There is something captivating in using soft materials to reimagine how we relate with the physical world.</p>
       <p class="bold">Projection and what's next:</p> 
       <p>I used a white wall to project the visuals on a white wall (Img 2). Doing this gave a different perspective on the idea than looking at the laptop screen. Right now, I have two main visual elements: background and foreground. The background contains randomized patterns from rectangles and circles, while the foreground includes organic, expressive shapes. Next, I will need to move on with the construction. Then, I can continue fixing up the code, but without the actual fabric itself, it's hard to imagine what the interaction would be like.  </p>
