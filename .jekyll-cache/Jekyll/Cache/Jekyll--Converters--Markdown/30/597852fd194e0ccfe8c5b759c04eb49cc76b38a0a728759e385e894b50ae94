      <p style="font-style: italic">"To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time. â€” Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition"</p>
      <h1>&#8226; Table as a generative and interactive space:</h1>
      <p>There is something about being at a table that sparks my inspiration and connection to the surrounding world. Whether I am at a dinner, a DIY activity, a classroom, or a house, I sit at a table. The table becomes the common thing between me and others, where we share conversations, stories, and ideas. I couldn't quite put into words how I find a table so special and intimate, until I encountered the writing titled "Around the protean table: From Judy Chicago to changing notions of digital era connection."</p>

      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p>A person is making banana bread (Why? Easy and universal recipe). The cooking setting: A camera attached on the person head, tracking hand movements. A screen on the side showing the user interface, including steps in the recipe and feedback on the process.</p>
      <h1>How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Hand tracking camera. Gesture recognisation using ML. UI design.</p>
      <h1>Why did I think of this idea?</h1>
      <p>When it comes to embodied interaction, my interests are immersive experiences into everyday life. I imagine to do something with physical objects and body movements, thus I narrow down the scope into body tracking and gesture.</p>
      <h1>Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do)</h1>
