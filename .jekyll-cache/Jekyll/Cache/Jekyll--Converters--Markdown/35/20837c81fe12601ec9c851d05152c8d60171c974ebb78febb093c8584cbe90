      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and visualizing different patterns from basic geometric shapes on Processing. During the exploration, I gradually shaped a clearer idea of what the final installation would be like. The process has not been linear. I have faced constant changes in the concept as I also imagined how to make the interaction more interesting. The learning is cultivating for me -- I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. In terms of

      <p>I tried to explore initial possibilities for my final project. In this demo I read two pressure sensors from Arduino. I then mapped the values to the parameters in the Processing's code to create animations with rotation, color, distance, and size. I explored some compositions using rectangles, lines, and circles. This exercise allowed me to dig a bit deeper into the sensors that I'm using and understand better what's possible in terms of visualisation.</p>
