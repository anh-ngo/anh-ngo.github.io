      <p style="font-style: italic">"The table has always been generative. Once that meant forms of domesticity and labor and was suffocating on those same terms. Women served the table, though possession was a different matter. Then tentatively, around it, they began to stitch stories into quilts and share them out loud, in oral tradition. Through such acts of togetherness, women made their mark, proffered new perspectives, shared knowledge and offered counsel."</p>
      <h1>&#8226; Table as a generative and interactive space:</h1>
      <p>There is something about being at a table that sparks my inspiration and connection to the surrounding world and other people. Whether it is a shared dinner, a DIY workshop, a classroom, . At a table, conversations and ideas arise. While it interests me to be a part of a table, I never thought of exploring it as part of my creative endeavours. Nor have I perceived a table as its own philosophy and sociology.</p>
      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p>A person is making banana bread (Why? Easy and universal recipe). The cooking setting: A camera attached on the person head, tracking hand movements. A screen on the side showing the user interface, including steps in the recipe and feedback on the process.</p>
      <h1>How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Hand tracking camera. Gesture recognisation using ML. UI design.</p>
      <h1>Why did I think of this idea?</h1>
      <p>When it comes to embodied interaction, my interests are immersive experiences into everyday life. I imagine to do something with physical objects and body movements, thus I narrow down the scope into body tracking and gesture.</p>
