      <p>Name of the project</p>
      <p>Vektorkollektor is a participatory installation that others can draw with a joystick. To me, the installation has quite a minimal look, at least from outside — everything seems to come down to a single plotter (that turns into a truck in this case) controlled by a joystick, but at the same time has its full characters and playfulness. The idea is simple yet genius. The way that the pen only moves between X and Y positions achieves the vectorized style as what makes it cool. I love this fun dynamic between the physical and digital!</p>
      <p>The images made by others are saved on a SD card and published on a website for others to use. I’m just so keen on the continuous participatory approach of this project. The hardwares were also secondhand according to the artists. The only thing that I don't know whether to call it a pro or con is that only a person can probably use at a time, so I have to wait for others to finish. Or as a collaborative way, one can close their eyes and let others guide them through voice.</p>
