      <p>2 LEDS 1 SWITCH</p>
      <p>How to make the switch control the states of multiple LEDs. In this assignment, pressing the button turns on the two LEDs one by one, then turns off both.</p>
      <p>The challenge for me is to figure out how to make the counter function increase by one when the button is pressed. This way I can give the conditions for the three states where LEDS turn on/off.</p>
