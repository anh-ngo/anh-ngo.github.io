      <p>2 LEDS 1 SWITCH</p>
      <p>How to make the switch control the states of multiple LEDs. In this assignment, pressing the button turns on the two LEDs one by one, then turns both off.</p>
      <p>The key learning, for me, is to figure out how to make the <i>counter</i> function only increase by one when the button is pressed. This way I can give the <i>if</i> conditions to the three states where the LEDS turn on/off. Looking at Matti's <a href="https://learn.newmedia.dog/tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/arduino/digital-io-rising-or-falling-edge/example">example</a>, the key is to check when the button is pressed and when it is not. </p>
      <p>The logic that helps me to understand is below:
      if the button's state is different from the state of the button the last time the loop was run
      then the button was pressed or released
      if the the button was pressed,
      we want to increase the counter
      if the button was released,
      we don't want to do anything to the counter Excited at the sucessful attempt, I added the forth step where both LEDs blink. </p>
