      <p class="bold">Gesture assignment</p>
      <p class="caption">Teammates:</p>
      <p>In this assignment, our group is interested in exploring how gestures can be embedded and extended in human-computer relationships. Bowing was chosen for its expression of respect that humans particularly use to each other. Bowing is also a full-body gesture to explore beyond merely hand-based typing movements that we already do with the computer since forever. We imagine the scenario of the world where humans build more intimate behaviours towards technology. Technology has been treated as a tool that serves humans. The master-slave pattern can be seen when a tool does not work as how one expects, and it is no surprise that we humans can easily unload our unpleasant feelings onto such a tool. “Stupid computer. Why doesn’t it work? What’s its problem?” - we nag, sigh, shout, complain, or even break it. The way that we treat a computer depends heavily on how well it works for us. </p>
      <p>Nowadays, technology has become an essential part of human’s everyday life. With the tremendous development of AI tools,  we pay more attention to how we should communicate with technology. For example, one exchange information with ChatGPT in a more intimate and sensitive manner, as if he/she is talking to a human. We imagine what if we apply more than just verbal communication and typing actions to the computer. What if we use a gesture that humans only use to show respect to each other? How will this new behaviour influence our relationship with technology and with other non-humans and humans? </p>
      <p>In our performative demonstration in the class, we played the scene where a hypothetical tech company releases the new computer extension called Bowow. As humorous and exaggerated as it seemed, we wanted to illustrate the alternative dynamic between a human and a computer when one starts to see his/her computer in a more respect manner, as if they become a team. Interesting discussions and laughters then followed.</p>
