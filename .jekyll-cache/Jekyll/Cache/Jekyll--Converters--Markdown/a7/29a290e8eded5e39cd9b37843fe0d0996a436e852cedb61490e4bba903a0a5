      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and visualizing different patterns from basic geometric shapes on Processing. During the exploration, I have faced constant reconsideration in the concept as I also imagined how to make the interaction more interesting. I gradually finalized the idea of creating a textile interface that contains several mended touchpoints. With this idea, I am curious about the relationship between physical touching and digital visualisation that overlays on top of each other.
      </p>
      <p> The learning for me is:</p>
       <p>â€” I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. I so far have used random() to generate unexpectedly interesting patterns out of basic shapes like rectangles and circles.</p>
       <p>â€” The process of working with soft materials opens up my new interest, even though I have just scratched the surface of electronic textiles. There is something captivating in using soft materials to reimagine how we relate with the physical world.</p>
