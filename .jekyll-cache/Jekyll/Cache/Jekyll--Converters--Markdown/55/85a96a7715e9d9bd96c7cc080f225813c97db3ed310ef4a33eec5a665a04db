      <p>1. THE PLAYFUL DRAWING TRUCK FROM SHAKE THAT BUTTON:</p>
      <p><a href="https://shakethatbutton.com/vektorkollektor/">Vektorkollektor</a> is a participatory installation that others can draw with a joystick. To me, the installation has quite a minimal look, at least from outside ‚Äî everything seems to come down to a single plotter (that turns into a truck in this case) controlled by a joystick, but at the same time has its full characters and playfulness. The idea is simple yet genius. The way that the pen only moves between X and Y positions achieves the vectorized style as what makes it cool. I love how you can get something that looks computerized by doing something physically.</p>
      <p>The images are saved on a SD card and published on a website for others to use. I‚Äôm just so keen on the continuous participatory approach of this project. The hardwares were also secondhand according to the artists. The everyday look, the playful drawing activity, and the participation are aspects I would want to take away for my projects. </p>
