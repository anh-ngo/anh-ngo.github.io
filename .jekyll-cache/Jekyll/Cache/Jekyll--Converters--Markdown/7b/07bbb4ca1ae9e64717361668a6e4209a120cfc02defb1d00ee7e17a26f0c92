      <h1>#1 PROPOSAL:</h1>
      <h1>Table as a generative and interactive space</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time. â€” Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition"</p>
      <p>There's a certain magic that emanates from a table. Regardless of the occasion - be it a restaurant, a knitting circle, a classroom, or a house - the table serves as the anchor that unites us with each other, creating a space for us to exchange thoughts, tales, and perspectives. In the Physical Computing course, I explored textile surface that responds to human touch. Although the execution was simple, it spurred me to ponder the possibilities of integrating such interactions into the communal experience of dining, in a more immersive and intuitive way using the notions of Embodied Interaction as the anchor.</p>
      <p>I recently read an article by Rose Higham-Stainon on PIN-UP that talked about how the table is a gathering place, where our connections with each other takeplace, change, and grow. The table thus changes, becoming a symbol of our shared experiences. In sum, it is the idea of the table being fluid and open that interests me.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"By table I mean the post-industrial table of the home, positionally contingent but often located in the kitchen...By protean, I mean a looseness, a tendency to change; the ability to do many different things. I mean, adaptability â€“â€“ a table as office, accidental canvas, cut-and-stick page â€” and shifting in meaning. I mean all the qualities of the table â€” its gravity, its capacity to gather us, its generosity â€” without the solid base. Or rather, the base exists, it just looks different now. It is unsteady â€” this table â€” but it is open."</p>
      <p>How can we experience the fluidity happened with and at a table? What does it feel like if the table becomes another layer of our conversation and experience? How might we use technologies to think through and shape creative practice around a table? </p>
      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h1>How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Hand tracking camera. Gesture recognisation using ML. UI design.</p>
      <h1>Why did I think of this idea?</h1>
      <p>When it comes to embodied interaction, my interests are immersive experiences into everyday life. I imagine to do something with physical objects and body movements, thus I narrow down the scope into body tracking and gesture.</p>
