      <p>2 LEDS 1 SWITCH</p>
      <p>How to make the switch control the states of multiple LEDs. In this assignment, pressing the button turns on the two LEDs one by one, then turns off both.</p>
      <p>The key learning, for me, is to figure out how to make the <i>counter</i> function only increase by one when the button is pressed. This way I can give the <i>if</i> conditions to the three states where the LEDS turn on/off. Looking at Matti's <a href="https://learn.newmedia.dog/tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/arduino/digital-io-rising-or-falling-edge/example">example</a>, the key is to check the change in the button's state from the previous loop. </p>
