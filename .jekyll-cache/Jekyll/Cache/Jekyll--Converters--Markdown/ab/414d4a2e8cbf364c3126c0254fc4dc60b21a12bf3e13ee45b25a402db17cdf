      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and exploring different patterns from basic geometric shapes. During the exploration, I gradually shaped a clearer idea of what the final installation would be like. The process was not linear -- I constantly felt like I could

      <p>I tried to explore initial possibilities for my final project. In this demo I read two pressure sensors from Arduino. I then mapped the values to the parameters in the Processing's code to create animations with rotation, color, distance, and size. I explored some compositions using rectangles, lines, and circles. This exercise allowed me to dig a bit deeper into the sensors that I'm using and understand better what's possible in terms of visualisation.</p>
