      <p class="bold">WEEK 7: Connect and Build</p>
      <h1>My to-do lists for the final week as followed:</h1>
      <p>â€” Build the soft materials</p>
      <p>â€” Build the hardwares</p>
      <p>â€” Connect the hardwares and softwares</p>
      <p>â€” Set up and debug</p>
      <h1>For the soft materials:</h1>
      <p>I first decided the positions of the sensors on the inner side of the fabric. I then sewed conductive yarns and Velostat in the "hamburger" structure for each sensor. Next, I connected two white electric wires to each sensor, creating a structure like in Img 1. I secured the wires and the sensors on the fabric by sewing with white threads.</p>
      <p>I find stitching often takes geometric shapes. Hence, I decided to embroider the pressing buttons, using methods from the inspirational book by Arounna Khounnoraj. The buttons were embroidered in the shapes that resemble the patterns projected on the fabric.</p>
      <h1>For the hardware:</h1>
      <p>To connect the sensors with Arduino, I built an electric board that can directly stick on top of the Arduino. I used a 2-pin connector for each pair of wires, resulting in 05 wire units. For each unit, a wire connects to 5V, while the other connects to an analog pin. Overall, the circuit includes 05 analog pins (inputs for 05 sensors), 05 resistors, 5V, and GRD.</p>
      <h1>For the code:</h1>
      <p>Map values from Aruino to Processing</p>
