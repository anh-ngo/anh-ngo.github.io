      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>During the course of two weeks, I created a more complex circuit that includes three soft sensors. The sensors send feedback that controls different patterns I coded on Processing. Based on the first proposal, I finalized the idea of creating a textile interface that contains several mended touchpoints. With this idea, I want to use textile as a medium to "stitch" together sensors, as well as explore the sensory experiences that physical touching and digital visualisation bring on top of each other.
      </p>
      <p class="bold"> At this point, I want to list the precious things that I have learned:</p>
       <p>â€” I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. Using basic shapes like rectangles and circles, I could generate different patterns just by playing around with random and transforming functions (Img 1).</p>
       <p>â€” The process of working with electronic hardwares and soft sensors opens up my new interest in electronic textiles, even though I have just scratched the surface. There is something captivating about using soft materials to reimagine how we relate with the physical world.</p>
       <p>â€” Project management is practiced well in this course. I started with something simple yet intrigues me to expand and deepen my understanding about it. </p>
       <p class="bold">Projection and what's next:</p> 
       <p>I used a white wall to project the visuals on a white wall (Img 2). Doing this gave a different perspective on the idea than looking at the laptop screen. Right now, I have two main visual elements: background and foreground. The background contains randomized patterns from rectangles and circles, while the foreground includes organic, expressive shapes. Next, I will need to move on with the construction. Then, I can continue fixing up the code, but without the actual fabric itself, it's hard to imagine what the interaction would be like.  </p>
