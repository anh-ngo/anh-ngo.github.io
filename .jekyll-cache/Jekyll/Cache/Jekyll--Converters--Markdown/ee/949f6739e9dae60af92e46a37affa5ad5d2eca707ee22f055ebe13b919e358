      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and visualizing different patterns from basic geometric shapes on Processing. During the exploration, I gradually shaped a clearer idea of what the final installation would be like. The process has not been linear. I have faced constant changes in the concept as I also imagined how to make the interaction more interesting.

      <p> The learning is cultivating for me â€” I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. The process of working with soft materials is also captivating, even though I have just scratched the surface of electronic textiles.</p>
