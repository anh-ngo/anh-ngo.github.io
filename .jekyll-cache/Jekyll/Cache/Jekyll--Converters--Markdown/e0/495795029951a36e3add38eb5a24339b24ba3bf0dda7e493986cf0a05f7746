      <h1>What is it that you want to create?</h1>
      <p>An immersive cooking experience</p>
      <h1>How do people interact with it?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure if this will be done for people to try, but at least a demo video of the experience will be helpful to illustrate the idea.</p>
      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p>A person is making banana bread (Why? Easy and universal recipe). The cooking setting: A camera attached on the person head, tracking hand movements. A screen on the side showing the user interface, including steps in the recipe and feedback on the process.</p>
      <h1> How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Hand tracking camera. Gesture recognisation using ML. UI design.</p>
      <h1>Why did I think of this idea?</h1>
