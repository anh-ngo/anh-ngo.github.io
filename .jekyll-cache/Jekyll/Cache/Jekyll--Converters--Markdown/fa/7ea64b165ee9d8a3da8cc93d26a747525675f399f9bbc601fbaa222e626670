      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>In these two weeks, I made progress in adding more sensors and visualizing different patterns from basic geometric shapes on Processing. During the exploration, I have faced constant reconsideration in the concept as I also imagined how to make the interaction more interesting. I gradually came to the idea of creating a textile interface that people can interact with and manipulate the visuals projected onto it.
      </p>
      <p> The learning is cultivating for me: 
      <br />
       â€” I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking.
       <br />
       â€” The process of working with soft materials opens up my new interest, even though I have just scratched the surface of electronic textiles. There is something captivating in using soft materials to reimagine how we related with it. In my project, I am curious about the relationship between physical touching and digital visualisation that overlays on top of each other. </p>
