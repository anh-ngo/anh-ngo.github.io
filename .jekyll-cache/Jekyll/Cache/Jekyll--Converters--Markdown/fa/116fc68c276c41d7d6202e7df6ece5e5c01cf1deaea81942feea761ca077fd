      <h1>#1 PROPOSAL:</h1>
      <h1>Table as a generative and interactive space</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time. — Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition"</p>
      <p>There is something about being at a table that sparks my inspiration and connection with the surrounding world. Whether I am at a dinner, a knitting session, a classroom, or a house, I sit at a table. The table becomes the common thing between me and the others, where we share conversations, stories, and ideas. My feeling about a table as a medium for art and media arose when I was doing my project for the Physical Computing course. There, I ended up building a fabric surface that interacts with human touches. Though the execution was simple, it made me imagine what it would be like if we approached the dining table with this kind of interaction.
      I was recently inspired by the article "Around the protean table: From Judy Chicago to changing notions of digital era connection." The article spoke to the idea of the table as a place where we come together to share stories, break bread, and connect with one another.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"By table I mean the post-industrial table of the home, positionally contingent but often located in the kitchen...By protean, I mean a looseness, a tendency to change; the ability to do many different things. I mean, adaptability –– a table as office, accidental canvas, cut-and-stick page — and shifting in meaning. I mean all the qualities of the table — its gravity, its capacity to gather us, its generosity — without the solid base. Or rather, the base exists, it just looks different now. It is unsteady — this table — but it is open."</p>
      <p>This got me thinking about how we could express the transformation and fluidity happened at a table.</p>
      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p>A person is making banana bread (Why? Easy and universal recipe). The cooking setting: A camera attached on the person head, tracking hand movements. A screen on the side showing the user interface, including steps in the recipe and feedback on the process.</p>
      <h1>How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Hand tracking camera. Gesture recognisation using ML. UI design.</p>
      <h1>Why did I think of this idea?</h1>
      <p>When it comes to embodied interaction, my interests are immersive experiences into everyday life. I imagine to do something with physical objects and body movements, thus I narrow down the scope into body tracking and gesture.</p>
