      <p class="bold">Explore visualisations with multiple sensors</p>
      <p>During the course of two weeks, I created a more complex circuit that includes three soft sensors. The sensors send feedback that controls different patterns I coded on Processing. Based on the first proposal, I finalized the idea of creating a textile interface that contains several mended touchpoints (Img 1). With this idea, I want to use textile as a medium to "stitch" together sensors, as well as explore the sensory experiences that physical touching and digital visualisation bring on top of each other.
      </p>
      <p class="bold"> At this point, I want to list the key precious things that I have learned:</p>
       <p>— I got to practice and evaluate my understanding of coding, in combination with the Processing course that I am taking. Using basic shapes like rectangles and circles, I could generate different patterns just by playing around with random and transforming functions (Img 2).</p>
       <p>— The process of working with electronic hardwares and soft sensors opens up my new interest in electronic textiles, even though I have just scratched the surface in this project. I started with something simple yet intrigues me to expand my exploration and deepen my understanding about it.</p>
       <p class="bold">What's next:</p> 
       <p>Right now, I have two main visual elements: background and foreground. The background contains randomized patterns from rectangles and circles, while the foreground includes organic, expressive shapes. Next, I will need to move on with the construction. Then, I adjust the code, data from sensors, and map the visual projection.</p>
