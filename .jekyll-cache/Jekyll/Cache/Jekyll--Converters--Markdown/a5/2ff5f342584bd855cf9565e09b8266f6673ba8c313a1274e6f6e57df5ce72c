      <p>Vektorkollektor is a participatory installation that welcomes others to draw with a joystick. To me, the installation has quite a minimal look, at least from outside â€” everything seems to come down to a single plotter (that turns into a truck in this case) controlled by a joystick, but at the same time has its full characters and playfulness. The idea is simple yet genius. The way that the pen only moves between X and Y positions also makes the drawings have its own vectorized style as what makes it cool. I love it! 
      <br />
      The images made by others are saved on a SD card and published on a website for others to use. Iâ€™m just so keen on the continuous participatory that this project has strived for. The hardwares were also secondhand according to the artists. The only thing that I would notice is that it seems to be used by only a person at a time, so others should wait for one to finish their drawing first.</p>
