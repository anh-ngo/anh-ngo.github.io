      <h1>Week 4: Mar 20 â€” 26 TouchDesigner tutorials</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic">Goals: Learn how to make audioreactive visuals and explore different generative art styles in TouchDesigner</p>
      <p>I managed to learn how audio works in TouchDesigner and create simple audioreactive visuals. I figured out potential visual effects for my project like watercolor and liquid abstract shapes manipulated by Noise TOP.</p>
      <p>While playing with my voice to change the visual effects, I also imagined how it would look like at a dining table:</p> 
      <p>â€”At this point, I would focus on detecting voice to trigger an assigned visual at a person's position. It would be interesting to investigate how a conversation dynamic will influence and be influenced by the projected visuals. What would happen if people see how much they and others talk? How the difference dynamics around a table, e.g. a debate, a dinner, an argument, etc, will be shown with the help of the visual projection?</p>
      <p>â€”The next thing is that perhaps people can also affect the visuals with their hands, e.g. when they reach to a plate, their hand is "printed" on the table and slowly disappears.</p>
      <p>â€”Visuals will change with the progress of the dining experience. For example, how will the visuals transform to tell a story from the beginning to the end of a dinner? From when people chat while waiting for food to eating the main dishes and then chatting again after the meal. From excitement and curiosity to enjoying and then relaxing.</p>
