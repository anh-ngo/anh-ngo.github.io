      <h1>#1 PROPOSAL:</h1>
      <h1>Table as a generative and interactive space</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time. â€” Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition"</p>
      <p>There's a certain magic that emanates from a table. Regardless of the occasion - be it a restaurant, a knitting circle, a classroom, or a house - the table serves as the anchor that unites us with each other, creating a space for us to exchange thoughts, tales, and perspectives. In the Physical Computing course, I explored textile surface that responds to human touch. Although the execution was simple, it spurred me to ponder the possibilities of integrating such interactions into the communal experience of dining, in a more immersive and intuitive way using the notions of Embodied Interaction as the anchor.</p>
      <p>I recently read an article by Rose Higham-Stainon on PIN-UP that talked about how the table is a gathering place, where our connections with each other takeplace, change, and grow. The table thus changes, becoming a symbol of our shared experiences. In sum, it is the idea of the table being fluid and open that interests me.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic">"By table I mean the post-industrial table of the home, positionally contingent but often located in the kitchen...By protean, I mean a looseness, a tendency to change; the ability to do many different things. I mean, adaptability â€“â€“ a table as office, accidental canvas, cut-and-stick page â€” and shifting in meaning. I mean all the qualities of the table â€” its gravity, its capacity to gather us, its generosity â€” without the solid base. Or rather, the base exists, it just looks different now. It is unsteady â€” this table â€” but it is open."</p>
      <p>How can we experience the fluidity happened with and at a table? What does it feel like if we see the table as another layer of our conversation and experience? How might we use technologies to think through and shape creative practice around a dining table? </p>
      <h1> How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?</h1>
      <p>A table that demonstrates a dining experience. The visual projection on the table is controlled by people's interaction and conversations. Hopefully, people experience the table as a moving and fluid entity as they interact, making them feel and/or think about the connection with the physical world and with each other through an everyday practice.</p>
      <h1>How may it be done?</h1>
      <p>Sound and hand gestures are possible inputs on top of my head to control the visual outputs projected on the table surface. For example, sound from people's talks comes into a mic, then is analysed and used to move and form the visual projection.</p>
      <h1>What may I need?</h1>
      <p>Visual from Processing.&lt;/h1&gt;
