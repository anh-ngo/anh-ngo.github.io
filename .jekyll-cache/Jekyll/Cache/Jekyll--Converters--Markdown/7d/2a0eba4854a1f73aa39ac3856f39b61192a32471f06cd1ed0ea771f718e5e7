      <p class="bold">WEEK 7 — Connect and Build</p>
      <p>My steps to build the installation as followed:</p>
      <p>— Build the soft sensors</p>
      <p>— Build the electronics</p>
      <p>— Map the sensors' values to the visualisation on Processing</p>
      <p>— Set up with a projector and debug</p>
      <h1>Build the soft sensors:</h1>
      <p>I first marked the positions of the sensors on the fabric. I then sewed conductive yarns and Velostat in a "hamburger" structure for each sensor. Next, I connected two white electric wires to each sensor, creating a structure like in Img 1. I secured the wires and the sensors on the fabric by sewing with white threads.</p>
      <p>I find stitching often takes geometric shapes. Hence, I decided to embroider the pressing buttons, using methods from the inspirational book by Arounna Khounnoraj. The buttons were embroidered in the shapes that resemble the patterns projected on the fabric.</p>
      <h1>Build the electronics:</h1>
      <p>To connect the sensors with Arduino, I built an electric board that can directly stick on top of the Arduino (Img 2). I used a 2-pin connector for each pair of wires, resulting in 05 wire units. For each unit, a wire connects to 5V, while the other connects to an analog pin. The overall circuit includes 05 analog pins (inputs for 05 sensors), 05 resistors, 5V, and GRD.</p>
      <h1>Map the sensors' values:</h1>
      <p>I added the sensors as inputs in Arduino IDE. I then mapped the sensors' values from Arduino to Processing, which determines the parameters of the visualisation in Processing (Img 3). I also set a timer that automatically resets the canvas after 10 seconds of the last press. For reference, access my codes on <a href="https://github.com/anh-ngo/physical-computing.git">Github&#8599;&#xFE0E;</a>&nbsp;</p>
      <h1>Set up:</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The setup is simple — a table, a fabric, and a projector (Img 4). The fabric is 70x55cm, hence I used a black 80x80x90cm stall. The computer and Arduino were hidden under the stall, while the projector was hooked on the ceiling. I then trimmed the fabric's edges, making sure that the projection would only stay inside the fabric. Special thanks to Matti for helping me set this up.</p>
